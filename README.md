# -live-crypto-tracker-two-builds-that-pulls-price-data-from-the-CoinGecko-API-
 built a small but powerful tool to solve a problem I kept running into: scattered crypto holdings and no quick way to see current portfolio value. The result: a live crypto tracker (two builds) that pulls price data from the CoinGecko API and computes portfolio metrics in real time.
